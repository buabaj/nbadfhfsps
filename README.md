non-blocking anomaly detector for high frequency signal processing systems

## what?

this is a high frequency signal anomaly detection system using various analysis techniques. It processes a continuous stream of data in real-time to identify anomalies through time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency analysis, utilizing the isolation forest, spectral and wavelet transform algos.

## why?

because i'm hacking on a high frequency signal processing project and i need something like this
